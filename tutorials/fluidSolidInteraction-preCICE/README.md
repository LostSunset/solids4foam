This directory contains examples of how to use solids4foam with the preCICE
coupling library (http://precice.org/). The examples show how to use solids4foam
for the solid and standard OpenFOAM fluid solvers for the fluid.

Currently, these tutorials have only been checked with OpenFOAM-v2012.

Before running these tutorials, you need to install preCICE and the preCICE
OpenFOAM adapter:

Note: the OpenFOAM adapter needs to have the solids4foam update.
